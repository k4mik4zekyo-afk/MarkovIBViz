STRUCTURAL TEST REPORT
========================================
[PASS] [Pre-IB] Acceptance probability monotonically decreasing: Acceptance monotonicity: up=pass; down=pass
[PASS] [Pre-IB] Rejection probability increases with failures: Rejection increase: up=pass; down=pass
[FAIL] [Pre-IB] Extension distributions widen with persistence: Extension widening (std_extension_ib): up=fail; down=fail
[PASS] [Pre-IB] Upside/downside approximately symmetric: count_ratio=1.03 (ok), ext_ratio=1.01 (ok), up_n=721, down_n=699
[PASS] [Pre-IB] Sample sizes exceed minimum thresholds: All base states have >= 10 samples
[PASS] [Post-IB] Acceptance probability monotonically decreasing: Acceptance monotonicity: up=pass; down=pass
[FAIL] [Post-IB] Rejection probability increases with failures: Rejection increase: up=fail; down=fail
[FAIL] [Post-IB] Extension distributions widen with persistence: Extension widening (std_extension_ib): up=fail; down=fail
[PASS] [Post-IB] Upside/downside approximately symmetric: count_ratio=1.12 (ok), ext_ratio=1.24 (ok), up_n=2406, down_n=2142
[PASS] [Post-IB] Sample sizes exceed minimum thresholds: All base states have >= 10 samples
========================================
Result: 7/10 passed

Note: Structural test failures indicate invalid assumptions
or insufficient data, not code errors.
